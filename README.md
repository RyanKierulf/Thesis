Whitman College Honors Thesis (Physics)

My thesis is on implementing the Multiple Shooting Method, a numerical method for solving two-point boundary value problems, to effectively model semiconductor devices. So far, I have a working program that correctly displays the potential, electric field, electron and hole concentrations, and band energies of a PN junction in equilibrium (no external bias applied).

My thesis is on implementing the Multiple Shooting Method, a numerical method for solving two-point boundary value problems, to effectively model semiconductor devices. So far, I have a working program that correctly models a symnetrical PN junction in equilibrium and produces the correct result for the potential, electric field, and electron and hole concentrations within the device.
